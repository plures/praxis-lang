# PRAXIS-LANG TRACKER — live state of the `.px` single-source-of-truth consolidation

**Purpose:** RESTART-PROOF handoff. If the gateway restarts or a fresh session picks this up, read this file + `ADR-praxis-lang-single-source-of-truth.md` and resume at the first unchecked stage. No re-derivation needed.

**Decision:** New repo `plures/praxis-lang` = single source of truth for everything `.px`. Rust-first, auto-updating schema, standard syntax, Rust+YAML surfaces, NAPI. Overrides the 2026-06-29 "praxis repo is the .px home" ruling (kbristol, 2026-06-30).

**Repo name:** `praxis-lang` (PROPOSED — pending kbristol final ✔; alts: `px-lang`, `px`).

## GROUND TRUTH (verified on disk 2026-06-30 — the 4-repo sprawl being collapsed)
- `praxis` repo Rust: `crates/{px-ast, px-grammar-gen, px-schema, px-schema-derive, praxis-native}`
- `praxis` repo TS: `core/{schema-engine(PSF), logic-engine, codegen, db-adapter}` (+ byte-identical copy in `packages/praxis-core/src/`)
- `praxis` repo sprawl: `csharp/`, `powershell/`, `deno.json`, `jsr.json`, `ui/` (carve out / leave as legacy)
- `pluresdb/crates/pluresdb-px` v3.0.1: DUPLICATE in-tree engine (`compiler.rs`/`executor.rs`/generated `grammar.pest` v4); does NOT import praxis crate (ADR-0017 drift)
- consumers: `pares-radix/crates/praxis`, `pares-agens/crates/praxis`
- Grammar v4 is STABLE since `195c67b` (2026-06-13). Construct set: import, entity, config, fact, rule, constraint, contract, function, trigger, procedure(dataflow+legacy), scenario + V1 steps + V2 code-block + type system.
- No `plures/px*` or `plures/*intent*` repo exists yet — name is free.

## STAGES (each gates the next; do not skip; verify on disk)

### [x] M0 — Decision locked + design doc (DONE 2026-06-30)
- [x] ADR written (`ADR-praxis-lang-single-source-of-truth.md`)
- [x] Tracker written (this file)
- [x] Confirmed no existing px/intent repo in plures org
- [x] **GATE RESOLVED (kbristol granted full autonomy 2026-06-30 17:05):** name = **`praxis-lang`**, visibility = **PUBLIC**. Decision made under delegated authority — no further approval needed for this epic.

### AUTONOMY + RESILIENCE (kbristol 2026-06-30 17:05: work autonomously, make future decisions yourself, make it uninterruptible + restart-proof)
- [x] Repo **created**: `plures/praxis-lang` PUBLIC — https://github.com/plures/praxis-lang
- [x] **Paused all unrelated crons** (RE-ENABLE THESE at M8): `prng-continuous-grind` 7490748f, `sprint-dashboard-refresh` e2fb05c8, `pluresLM-maintenance` 87f4aa17, `release-pipeline-health` 0889c131, `morning-briefing` de7cf03f, `praxisbot-deployment-drift` 9f25bf10, `afternoon-review` 0610a896, `ado-sprint-support-story` 05d2e495
- [x] **Continuation cron created**: `praxis-lang-epic-continuation` id `0b3ef1e8-0c2a-4c95-b6a7-8162a0e8f0c4` — hourly (`0 * * * *` America/Los_Angeles), wakes MAIN session, reads this tracker, advances the next unchecked stage. DISABLE this at M8.
- [x] Durable plan committed to git in `plures/praxis-lang` (local clone `C:\Projects\praxis-lang`) with milestone-coded messages so the plan survives even a workspace wipe.\n- **LOOSE END from prior work (not part of this epic):** pares-radix PR #461 (Track A Thread-3 cleanup) still needs a final CI-green squash-merge + worktree `C:/Projects/worktrees/thread3-testing-cleanup` reclaim. Handle opportunistically; do not let it block the epic.

### [x] M1 — Create the repo + skeleton workspace (DONE 2026-06-30)
- [x] `gh repo create plures/praxis-lang` PUBLIC, default branch `main` (MIT LICENSE committed in skeleton; GitHub license auto-detect will pick it up)
- [x] Cargo workspace skeleton with 9 empty-but-buildable crates per ADR §3.2 (px-ast, px-grammar-gen, px-grammar, px-schema, px-schema-derive, px-compiler, px-eval, px-yaml, px-napi). `cargo build`+`cargo test`+`cargo fmt --check`+`cargo clippy -D warnings` all green locally.
- [x] CI scaffold (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): build/test/fmt/clippy + placeholder `verify-grammar`/`verify-schema` lanes (become real regenerate-and-diff drift gates in M3/M4). **Branch protection ON `main`** (strict, requires all 3 checks: build+test, verify-grammar, verify-schema).
- [x] Acceptance: empty workspace **builds GREEN in CI** — pushed as `9fba208`, CI run 28486372521 = success (build+test ✓, verify-grammar ✓, verify-schema ✓).

### [x] M2 — Best-concepts reconciliation (the "select the best" pass) — DONE 2026-06-30 (VERIFIED)
- [x] Mapped PSF ↔ px-ast ↔ grammar v4 construct-by-construct → `PXLANG-M2-RECONCILIATION.md` (227 lines, evidence-grounded)
- [x] **KEY FINDING (verified by direct grep):** PSF is NOT the `.px` language — it's a visual app/canvas builder schema (`psf.ts`: 0 hits for entity/contract/procedure/scenario/import/duration; 20 canvas/17 component/15 model/12 flow/13 event). `px-ast ↔ grammar v4` are ALREADY the single codegen-linked language representation (12/12 constructs + both expr layers + type system align).
- [x] **Canonical set RATIFIED: `px-ast` as-is** = single source of truth for the language. Grammar generated from it (ADR-0021). Keep dual V1/V2 expression layers. Dataflow-v3 procedures primary; legacy-v1 + trigger = migration sugar.
- [x] **Corrected design:** PSF does NOT enter `praxis-lang`. Schema artifact = pure JSON-Schema projection of px-ast (schemars). PSF stays downstream as an `x-app`/`x-canvas` extension with the canvas/app-framework.
- Punch-list produced: P0 grammar-alignment fixes (entity `map[K,V]`, `null` token, scenario.given, rule `let`), P1 make-schema-a-projection, P2 expressiveness polish, P3 YAML surface.

### [ ] M3 — Migrate the Rust language core (Rust-first)
- [ ] Move `px-ast`, `px-grammar-gen`, generated grammar, `px-schema`, `px-schema-derive` into the new repo (preserve history where feasible via git filter / subtree)
- [ ] Fold the best of `pluresdb-px` compiler/executor into `px-compiler`/`px-eval`; fold `praxis-native` evaluator + constraint primitives into `px-eval`
- [ ] Acceptance: `cargo build` + `cargo test` green in new repo; all current `.px` example files parse; grammar regenerates deterministically (verify-grammar passes)

### [ ] M4 — Schema-auto-update-on-release (P2 / C-DRIFT-001 structural)
- [ ] `px-schema` emits `schema/px.schema.json` (JSON-Schema PROJECTION of px-ast via schemars/JsonSchema derives) + `schema/px.schema.px` generated FROM `px-ast`. (NOT a PSF re-root — see M2 finding.)
- [ ] Prereq from M2: add `schemars::JsonSchema` derives to px-ast, stabilize serde tagging on key enums, namespace/drop `span` from the projection
- [ ] CI gate: regenerate-and-diff — build fails if committed schema/grammar != regenerated
- [ ] Release workflow regenerates + commits/publishes schema as part of every release (no manual step)
- [ ] Acceptance: deliberately change an AST construct → CI goes red until schema regenerated → proves the gate; release dry-run produces an updated schema artifact

### [ ] M5 — YAML surface + NAPI bindings (P4 + P5)
- [ ] `px-yaml`: YAML <-> px-ast round-trip (same types, no second truth); round-trip tests
- [ ] `px-napi`: NAPI-RS bindings; published TS package loads native addon; smoke test from Node
- [ ] Acceptance: a `.px` file and its `.yaml` equivalent both deserialize to identical AST (asserted); Node can compile/evaluate a `.px` via the addon (build-the-binary-run-the-binary)

### [ ] M6 — Rewire downstream consumers
- [ ] `pluresdb`: delete in-tree `pluresdb-px` engine; `pluresdb-px` imports `praxis-lang` + keeps ONLY procedure tooling (closes ADR-0017)
- [ ] `pares-radix` + `pares-agens`: point `crates/praxis` at `praxis-lang` (direct for primitives / via pluresdb for procedures)
- [ ] Acceptance: each downstream repo builds + its `.px` tests pass against `praxis-lang`; no repo carries a second grammar

### [ ] M7 — Guide override + old-repo cleanup
- [ ] Update `PLURES-FOUNDATION.md`: `praxis-lang` = the `.px` language home; amend/supersede the 2026-06-29 ruling; demote `praxis` repo to TS app-framework/canvas only
- [ ] **PSF/canvas stays with the app-framework** (old `praxis` repo or its successor) as the `x-app`/`x-canvas` extension — do NOT move PSF into `praxis-lang` (M2 finding)
- [ ] Decide fate of old `praxis` repo language crates (retire/redirect) + carve out C#/PowerShell sprawl
- [ ] Update `repo-routing-validation.md` + decision tree so "where does .px go?" answers `praxis-lang`
- [ ] Acceptance: guide and reality match; a routing check points all `.px`-language code at `praxis-lang`

### [ ] M8 — Final verify (never-confused-again proof)
- [ ] Full cross-repo build green; one canonical grammar+schema, auto-regenerated, CI-enforced
- [ ] Back-brief kbristol with the final map
- [ ] Acceptance: searching the org for `.px` grammar/AST/compiler yields exactly ONE home

## EXECUTION LOG (append per session)
- 2026-06-30 16:55 PDT — kbristol overrode the 6/29 ruling, chose Path A (new repo). ADR + tracker written. Verified name is free, no existing repo. Track B (pluresLM #146) landed as #152 `16a2f74` in parallel. Awaiting M0 gate (repo name + visibility) before M1; M2 reconciliation can begin immediately.

- 2026-06-30 17:xx PDT - M2 reconciliation COMPLETE + VERIFIED. Direct grep confirmed PSF != the .px language (0 language-construct hits, 20+ canvas/app hits). px-ast ratified as sole SSOT; grammar generated from it. Design CORRECTED: PSF does NOT enter praxis-lang (stays downstream as x-app/x-canvas extension); schema artifact = pure JSON-Schema projection of px-ast. praxis-lang is now a focused Rust-first language repo, cleaner than first drafted. ADR + M4/M7 updated. Still awaiting M0 gate (repo name + visibility) before M1 create.

- 2026-06-30 18:0x PDT (autonomous continuation wake) - M1 COMPLETE. Verified on disk/GitHub first: repo plures/praxis-lang exists PUBLIC on `main` but had only the M0 docs commit (no skeleton), license undetected. Advanced M1: added MIT LICENSE, .gitignore, README, root workspace Cargo.toml, and 9 empty-but-buildable crates per ADR §3.2. `cargo build`/`test`/`fmt --check`/`clippy -D warnings` all green locally. Added CI (`ci.yml`) with build/test/fmt/clippy + placeholder verify-grammar/verify-schema drift lanes. Committed `9fba208` ("M1: scaffold Cargo workspace + CI + MIT license"), pushed to main, CI run 28486372521 triggered. NEXT WAKE: confirm CI green (if not already logged), set branch protection opportunistically, then start M3 (migrate px-ast + grammar-gen + generated grammar + px-schema/-derive from C:\Projects\praxis, preserving history where feasible; fold pluresdb-px compiler/executor + praxis-native evaluator per ADR).
